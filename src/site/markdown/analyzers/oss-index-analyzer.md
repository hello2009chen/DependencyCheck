OSS Index Analyzer
================

Uses the [OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/) APIs to report on
vulnerabilities not found in the NVD. The collection of identified Package-URL
identifiers are submitted to the OSS Index for analysis and the resulting
identified vulnerabilities are included in the report.

This analyzer requires an Internet connection.
