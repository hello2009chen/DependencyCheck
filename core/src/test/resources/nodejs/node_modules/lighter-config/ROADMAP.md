# lighter-config Roadmap

***This is a living document. It describes priorities as they are perceived
today, and it can evolve over time.***

## `--debug` detection
It would be nice if `lighter-config` could detect when node is running with
the `--debug` flag, in addition to detecting if `NODE_ENV=debug`.

## Got ideas?
If you have ideas for features that should be in this roadmap, please submit
a pull request.
